# Flask-test
Learning to do a simple web app using flask :)

I need to know some basics on what does it take to make a web server, do routing, template rendering and APIs building, 
for a later personal project which will consist in a very simple web app which will depend on all that i just mentioned
and a database connection of course.
I'll be using python because it's very easy to implement and very readable specially if I want to add more contributors later
into my project, so they'll be able to understand and get going pretty quickly.
I choose to use Flask because it seemed like a very simple aprochable and light framework to satisfy all my app needs.
